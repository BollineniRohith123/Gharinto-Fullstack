4.1 Technology Stack (Enhanced)
Layer	Technology	Rationale
Frontend	React.js (v19+), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, Font Awesome, CRACO	React provides a component-based architecture for interactive UIs. TypeScript ensures type safety. Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to highly customizable and responsive styling, adhering to the pale green, black, and green theme (client reference). Chart.js for data visualization. Font Awesome for a rich icon set. CRACO for flexible Create React App configurations.
State Management	Redux Toolkit, React Query	Redux Toolkit for predictable and scalable client-side state management, with built-in dev tools for debugging. React Query for efficient server state management, enabling caching, background re-fetching, and optimistic UI updates, significantly improving perceived performance and reducing complex data fetching logic.
UI Components	Material-UI, Ant Design, Custom Component Library	Leveraging battle-tested UI component libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design for rapid development of consistent and accessible UI elements. A Custom Component Library will be developed for brand-specific elements and complex interactive components that are unique to Gharinto's design system.
Mobile	React Native	Enables efficient cross-platform (iOS/Android) mobile application development from a single codebase, accelerating time-to-market for customer and designer portals, ensuring a consistent experience across web and mobile.
Backend	Node.js (Express/NestJS)	Excellent choice for building scalable, real-time, and event-driven APIs due to its non-blocking I/O model. A microservices architecture is strongly recommended for long-term scalability, independent deployment of services (e.g., User Service, Project Service, Financial Service, Inventory Service), and improved fault isolation.
Database	PostgreSQL (Primary) + MongoDB (Secondary for flexible data)	PostgreSQL serves as the primary relational database for structured data (users, roles, permissions, projects, financial transactions, static material attributes), ensuring strong data integrity, complex querying capabilities, and ACID compliance. MongoDB (or similar NoSQL like Couchbase) is used as a secondary database for flexible, document-based data (e.g., dynamic BOQ details, complex design file metadata, communication logs, user preferences, activity feeds), allowing rapid iteration and schema evolution.
Cache	Redis	High-performance in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., dashboard metrics, material catalog lookups, session management, dynamically loaded user permissions/menus), significantly improving API response times and reducing database load. Also used for real-time messaging queues and rate limiting.
Real-time	Socket.io	Enables bi-directional, low-latency communication between clients and server, crucial for live project progress updates, real-time chat, instant notifications, and dynamic inventory synchronization. Supports various transport mechanisms (WebSockets, long polling) for broad compatibility.
File Storage	AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage	Highly scalable, durable, and cost-effective object storage for all static assets, user-uploaded content (design files, high-resolution project photos, project documents, warranty certificates), and automated backups. Integrated with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast content delivery globally.
Search	Elasticsearch / Algolia	Powerful search engine for advanced full-text search and faceted search capabilities across projects, materials, leads, and users, providing fast and highly relevant search results (e.g., in Material Catalog, Lead Marketplace, Admin User Search, Document Vault).
Analytics	Google Analytics + PostHog + Custom BI Tool	Google Analytics for high-level website traffic and basic user behavior. PostHog for granular product analytics, feature usage tracking, and A/B testing capabilities. Integration with a Custom Business Intelligence (BI) Tool (e.g., Metabase, Power BI, or Tableau) for complex data analysis, custom dashboards for Super Admin, and detailed operational reporting.
DevOps	AWS/GCP/Azure (Containerization with Docker/Kubernetes)	Utilizes a robust cloud infrastructure (AWS EC2, ECS/EKS; GCP Compute Engine, GKE; Azure VMs, AKS) for scalable hosting. Implements comprehensive CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for automated testing and deployments. Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) and centralized logging (ELK stack) are essential for operational visibility. Docker for consistent environments and Kubernetes for orchestration of microservices.
CRM System	LeadPro CRM + Perfex CRM with LeadPilot AI	LeadPro CRM will serve as the primary comprehensive lead management and call center platform. Perfex CRM with LeadPilot AI module will provide advanced voice automation, intelligent call routing, and AI-powered lead engagement, integrated for seamless data flow.
VoIP System	Twilio / Plivo	Twilio or Plivo will be integrated as the core VoIP system for all click-to-call functionality, automated dialing, call recording, and transcription services directly within the CRM and Gharinto dashboards.
API Integration	Zapier / Make (Integromat)	For robust and scalable integration between multiple CRM systems, external voice platforms, and other third-party applications, providing workflow automation capabilities.
