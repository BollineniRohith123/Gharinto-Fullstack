| Super Admin  | Complete system access; configure roles, commissions, permissions; set up cities; live system health; basic platform analytics.           |
| Admin        | Operations setup; onboarding of designers/vendors/employees; lead assignment; city filter; monitor financials; reroute/escalate leads.    |
| Designer     | Accept/decline leads; create designs; communicate with customers; manage project BOQ & docs; onboard team members (for test).             |
| Customer     | Register/request project; view project status; communicate with designer/PM; access digital vault (project docs, contracts, images).      |
| Vendor       | Register; list products/services; manage basic inventory; receive orders; fulfill and update order status.                                |
| Employee     | Task-specific access; support onboarding/testing for role workflows (optional, for test cities only).                                     |

- **Dynamic Role Management:** All permissions, cardinality, sidebars, menus driven via DB for total flexibility (no static FE sidebars).

## 4. Phase-1 Functional Modules

### 4.1 Super Admin Dashboard
- City management (add/edit/delete, regional settings).
- Global system/stats view (users, projects, leads, vendors).
- Role/permission assignment; see all active users by role/city.
- Configure commission (%), platform fees, and assignment algorithms.
- Employee lifecycle management: Add, revoke, transfer roles.
- System logs: All major changes/events with timestamps.

### 4.2 Operations Admin Panel
- View/add/approve new designers/vendors/employees.

- Financial monitoring: Real-time transaction summary (high-level).

### 4.3 Lead & Project Management Backbone
- Unified pipeline to receive and manage all new leads (from site, referrals, campaigns).
- Segmentation: by city, project type, priority.
- Automated assignment on logic (rotate, skill, load-balancing), with manual override.
- Track each project's stage (lead, design assigned, in progress, completed).
- Trigger notifications for assignment, approvals, escalations.
- Project digital folder: docs, contracts, images, design files.
- Timeline: Gantt/phase tracker (basic, for phase-1).

### 4.4 Designer Portal
- View assigned leads, accept/decline.
- Basic project tracker (milestones, status updates, comms).
- Upload designs/BOQ, access resource vault.
- In-app chat/email with customer & admin/PM.
- Analytics: See basic lead conversion ratio, project statuses.

### 4.5 Vendor Portal
- Partner onboarding (approval workflow).
- Product/service listing, including pricing (with admin review).
- Basic inventory tracking (quantity, location, reorder, restock alert).
- Order receipt and fulfillment update flow.
- View order/payments dashboard (summary only in v1).

### 4.6 Customer Portal
- Register/view dashboard of own projects.
- See project status (milestones, assigned designer/PM, timeline).
- Digital vault: All project docs, agreements, designs.
- In-app communication with designer & admin (basic, logs preserved).
- Feedback and escalation form (routes to admin).

### 4.7 Notifications & Messaging (Core)

## 5. Technical Architecture

**Frontend:** React v19 (TypeScript), Tailwind, roles/menus fetched from API/DB.
**Backend:** Node.js (Express or Nest), microservices for user/role, project, lead, notification.
**DB:** PostgreSQL (main, normalized), Redis (cache/sessions), S3-compatible storage for documents.
**APIs:** Secure REST (OAuth2/JWT), all permissions DB-driven; minimal hardcoding.
**Security:** MFA, SSO for admin/super admin, scheduled token expiry, audit logs, E2EE for sensitive doc transfer, role-based/attribute checks at API/middleware.
